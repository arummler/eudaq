1.) Enable Vetoing: Raise clock line outside of handshake in order to stop data taking
	a) Mandatory: Choose output for clock: AUX, Serial, USB
	b) Optional: Listen to SPS spill signal in order to try to have it read during inter spill
	c) Optional: Listen to trigger ID on another/same channel
		i) Mandatory: Choose input for ID: Channel, Serial, USB
2.) Enable trigger/busy
	a) Mandatory: Choose output for busy: AUX, Serial, USB
	b) Optional: Use for readout stop (sufficiently early?)
		i) Optional: Listen to SPS spill signal in order to try to have it read during inter spill
	c) Optional: Listen to trigger ID on another/same channel
		i) Mandatory: Choose input for ID: Channel, Serial, USB
3.) Enable trigger vetoing: NIM high on trigger input configured as veto
	a) Mandatory: Choose output for clock: AUX, Serial, USB
	b) Optional: Listen to SPS spill signal in order to try to have it read during inter spill
	c) Optional: Listen to trigger ID on another/same channel
		i) Mandatory: Choose input for ID: Channel, Serial, USB
General:
	Assign inputs and outputs:
		output[tlu_clock_input]=AUX, Serial, USB
		output[tlu_trigger_in_as_veto]=AUX, Serial, USB
		input[tlu_trigger_out] = AUX, Serial, USB
